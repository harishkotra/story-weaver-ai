## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   A Gaia API Key ([Get one here](https://docs.gaianet.ai/getting-started/authentication))

### Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/harishkotra/story-weaver-ai.git
    cd story-weaver-ai
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. This file is ignored by Git and is used for local environment configuration.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Now, open `.env.local` and add your API key:

    ```env
    # .env.local

    # Required: Your API Key for the Gaia LLM service (or other OpenAI-compatible API)
    GAIA_API_KEY="your_actual_gaia_api_key_here"

    # Optional: If Gaia changes their endpoint or you use a different compatible service
    # Default is 'https://llama70b.gaia.domains/v1' if not set
    GAIA_API_ENDPOINT="https://your-custom-openai-compatible-endpoint/v1"
    GAIA_API_MODEL="llama70b"
    ```
    **Important:** Replace `"your_actual_gaia_api_key_here"` with your real API key. ([Get one here](https://docs.gaianet.ai/getting-started/authentication))

4.  **Initialize shadcn/ui (if you need to add more components):**
    While the project is set up, if you intend to add more shadcn/ui components later, you might need to run init (though it should be configured already):
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
    Follow the prompts, accepting the defaults or aligning with existing project configuration (`src/app/globals.css`, `tailwind.config.ts`, aliases `@/components` and `@/lib/utils`).

### Running the Application Locally

1.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

2.  **Open your browser:**
    Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

You should now see the StoryWeaver AI application running!
